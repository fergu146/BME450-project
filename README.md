## Project decription
Our team's goal in this project is to develop a neural network that will identify the food in a given image and output a recipe that utilizes that food as an ingredient. Our process for developing this model is described in the following paragraphs.
First, we will make a neural network that identifies which food item is in the given picture. In this step, we will use a Kaggle dataset with food images [1]. Next, we will expand upon this neural network by implementing larger datasets and refining our model, which will increase the accuracy of the model. Finally, we will implement this neural network with another section of code to find a recipe from a recipe dataset [2] that utilizes the food identified in the first step. Our final deliverable will be a neural network that takes in a single image of a food item and outputs a recipe with that food item in it.
If we have additional time, we have a couple of ideas on how we can expand upon this model. First, we might choose to write a section of code that will output the additional ingredients that will be required by the recipe that was already outputted. Another option would be to iterate our neural network to identify 2+ images of food items and output a recipe that includes both of those food items. Ideally, this could be iterated many times until we reach the point where you can upload images of all the ingredients you have on hand, then the neural network will output a recipe with those specific ingredients. Although these two things are not the goal of our project, if there is time, we would like to try to implement one of these elements.
